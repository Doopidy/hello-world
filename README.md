# hello-world
This is my first repository!

I've started learning R programming recently and I think that learning Git simultaneously will make my programming skills better.

I have no previous experience with coding, but it really seems fun. In addition to fun, I believe it will help me improve my career options because I work as a safety physician.

That would be all for now.

Sayonara bitches.
